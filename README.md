# Mind-Maps
Mind maps for various areas of study from college courses and ongoing learning. Some are more complete than others and of course will contain errors, so buyer beware. Mind maps are completed with Free Mind, a cool free Java tool. I like it, but frankly it is showing its age a little. See https://freemind.sourceforge.io/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.
