# Mind-Maps
Mind maps for various areas of study from college courses and ongoing learning. Some are more complete than others and of course will contain errors. Mind maps are completed with Free Mind, a cool free Java tool. I have used it a lot over the years, but frankly it is showing its age a little. You can find the application here https://freemind.sourceforge.io/wiki/index.php/Main_Page.
